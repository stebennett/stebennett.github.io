<p>As a Java developer, I&#8217;m acutely aware of the importance of creating and maintaining the right abstractions for the code I write. We generally approach this idea by removing duplication and complexity through the creation of reusable functions, methods or classes. When done well, the correct application of abstractions result in concise, readable, maintainable code, which can be adapted easily for future requirements. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s no wonder then, that I&#8217;ve discovered that some programmers seemingly apply these same principles to the way they communicate with members of their teams. Rather than being specific about what they mean, we use convenient short-hand to convey our point. Whilst this undoubtedly started off as a way of being more efficient, I&#8217;ve noticed that the habit of communicating in abstractions can cause organisational issues.</p>



<p>To illustrate, I want to talk about two of the most common abstractions I come across &#8211; &#8220;not being technical enough&#8221; and &#8220;agile&#8221;.</p>



<h3>&#8220;Not Technical Enough&#8221;</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to run software engineer hiring practices across all of my most recent roles. As part of ensuring that our process was fair, balanced and open to all candidates, we needed to remove the &#8220;not technical enough&#8221; abstraction from our hiring feedback vocabulary. </p>



<p>On the surface, the phrase seems reasonable &#8211; we&#8217;re hiring for Software Engineers so it&#8217;s important that the candidates show a level of technical ability. Yet the short-hand is harmful as it lacks specificity and provides no evidence for why and how the candidate misses the mark. Most of the time this phrase is used, the interviewer is really saying is &#8220;this person isn&#8217;t like me&#8221;. </p>



<p>How do I know this? When I hear this feedback I now ask two follow up questions to the interviewer:</p>



<ol><li>What is your expectation of technical competence?</li><li>How does this person not meet your expectations of technical competence?</li></ol>



<p>How</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a trivially easy thing to say when asked to give feedback on a candidate &#8211; &#8220;they&#8217;re not technical enough&#8221;. Yet this short-hand is particularly harmful. On the surface it seems reasonable, we&#8217;re hiring for e</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>In my experience, &#8220;not being technical enough&#8221; is something that is often levelled at under-represented folk in technology as the reason for a hire or promotion not to happen. Scratching below the surface, often this actually means &#8220;they&#8217;re not like me&#8221;.</p>



<p>As a person of privilege, I can see why people use this short-hand to justify their decision making. It&#8217;s easy to say and more often than not, in my experience, it won&#8217;t get challenged.</p>



<p>I want to change that view. Anytime someone I&#8217;m working with dismisses another person as &#8220;not being technical enough&#8221; I&#8217;m challenging them with two questions:</p>



<ol><li></li></ol>



<p>By taking this approach I&#8217;m asking people to get more specific with their expectations. I found that in some cases that the person giving the feedback couldn&#8217;t </p>
