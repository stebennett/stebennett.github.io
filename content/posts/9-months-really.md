It's been almost nine months since my last blog entry. I've never been a prolific writer as you can see this in the gaps between posts. I think I've found the reason why.

Recently I came across the article [Speed Matters](http://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters) by James Somers.  Right there, in the second paragraph of the article, Somers summed up exactly my relationship with this blog:

> "If every time you write a blog post it takes you six months, and you're sitting around your apartment on a Sunday afternoon thinking of stuff to do, you're probably not going to think of starting a blog post, because it'll feel too expensive."

I feel seen. 

Each time I've thought about writing a post, the idea comes into my head, I make a start and then it doesn't get finished. Or in the rare case it does get published it takes me hours or weeks of refinement and editing.

Each time I go round this loop, turning my next idea into text becomes harder to do.

I'm not about to say I'm a changed man and that you can expect daily posts. However, I will aim to work more quickly, worrying less about getting the content *just right* before hitting publish.

And as case in point, this post only took me 10 minutes from idea to publishing. Start as you mean to go on.
