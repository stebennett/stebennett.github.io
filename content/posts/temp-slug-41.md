<p>Late in 2018, I attended the <a href="https://less.works/courses/less-practitioner.html">Certified LeSS Practitioner</a> course, hosted by Karim Harbott.  On the course we spent a lot of time focusing on the design of a delivery system, paying particular attention to how the decisions we make as leaders or coaches impact the outcomes of that system. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ll be honest and say that I don&#8217;t put a lot of weight in agile certification &#8211; I feel a little weird calling myself a Certified Practitioner of anything having only attended a 3-day course &#8211; yet I thought the course was excellent, providing a great practical introduction to the topic of systems thinking. </p>



<p>A couple of months before the course, I had started some deeper research around <a href="https://amzn.to/2HC09bW">systems thinking</a>. I was looking into how I could apply the technique to better understand our software delivery system.</p>

<p>Last week, Karim tweeted out something which really struck a chord with me.</p>

<p>Through my research over recent months, it&#8217;s become clear to me a software team following the principles of the  <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> will never truly succeed when the constructs around them are fighting against those same principles. And even when a software development team does achieve &#8220;success&#8221;, it&#8217;s apparent that the team have the potential to achieve much more if they have don&#8217;t have to fight the system.</p>



<p>In less than 280 characters, Karim has so succinctly described one of the key concepts I&#8217;d been talking about recently with my peers. </p>



<p>To achieve true agility, it&#8217;s necessary to change more than how a Product Development organization operates. You need to look at the full system &#8211; how the complete company operates. </p>



<p>But before doing this, you need to understand what the company truly values. As development teams, we&#8217;re surrounded by literature and peers extolling the virtues of experimentation, fast feedback cycles, and agility. My experience is that traditional corporate practices such as planning, budgeting, objective setting, and recognition are based on principles and values which are often at odds with those supporting development with agility.</p>



<p>Changes these practices starts with understanding what the company values. To achieve this understanding, it becomes necessary to learn how the system of delivery operates within the organization. By observing how work happens in the organization you&#8217;ll see what that group really values. </p>



<ul><li>How does work flow in the system?</li><li>What is rewarded? </li><li>What is punished?</li><li>What constitutes a crisis? </li><li>What is celebrated?</li></ul>



<p>Answers to questions such as these lead you towards the true values of an organization, as well as giving you a true reading of the corporate culture. Tools such as the surveys described in the <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/the-culture-factor">HBR Culture Factor</a> can also be used to determine an organizations values and culture.</p>



<p>Taking the time to understand the values of the overall system (company) is key to understanding how to collectively achieve success within it. Achieving a deeper understanding of the system and culture also gives you the necessary information to start conversations to build the necessary alignment across the organization. </p>



<p>After this exercise, if you determine that the company values agility you can then look for the ways to increase overall system agility. As Karim points out in his tweet, it will take more than just the development team changing their practices to achieve agility. Practices, policies, and processes across the company will all need to change to support the development of agility.</p>



<p>Not all organizations will decide that agility is right for them. In these organizations, efforts to improve development team agility without addressing the way the complete system operates will lead to a series of local optimizations, each of which is unlikely to have a substantial effect on progress. Note that for this context, this might be OK, just make sure that the engineering team understands their context.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re an engineering leader looking to develop further agility within your teams, take the time to understand the system within which you operate. </p>
