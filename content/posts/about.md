Steve is people focussed engineering leader. He is passionate about helping teams to develop products using clean, test driven code. Steve has worked in multiple engineering teams, all sharing the same passions of good code, agile development and great products.

Steve received a [Commodore 64](#) as a Christmas present when he was still very young. From that moment on, he was hooked on technology. A PC donated from a friend allowed him to build on this passion. He spent most of his youth writing small programs and building websites. This path eventually led to him graduating from the [University of York](http://www.york.ac.uk/) in 2006 with a BEng in Computer Science.

Following graduation, Steve joined [BT](http://www.btplc.com/) as a member of their 2006 graduate intake. In this role, he built Windows client applications using C++, C#, before moving to building webservices in Java J2EE. At BT, he got his first exposure to the world of Test Driven Development (TDD) and Unit Testing.

Steve moved to [Yell Group](http://hibucorporate.com/) (now hibu) in 2008 after completing the graduate scheme. Here he developed applications and services for [Yell.com](http://www.yell.com), eventually becoming one of the senior technical leaders in the group. He also got his first exposure to managing individual contributors, and starting to build on his management and leadership skills.

In 2013, Steve joined the newly formed [eBay](http://www.ebayinc.com) European Product Development (EPD) team. This small team of engineers set out with the aim to build a centre of excellence for product development in eBay. The team focussed on delivering products with agility, using a mixture of Scrum and Kanban, backed up with XP practices such as TDD and Pair-Programming.

He led his scrum team in the creation of the first cross-device responsive experience for the retail promotions platform, before moving to a new team to deliver new internal tooling for merchandisers. An active part of the EPD leadership team, Steve took responsibility for the hiring of all new engineers, conference attendance and aspects of the team PR.

In 2016, Steve joined the [Marks and Spencer Digital](http://www.mandsdigital.com) team as a Engineering Manager. In a move away from the day-to-day development tasks, he helped this team to adapt to agile delivery, working with teams to build great experiences for customers of [marksandspencer.com](https://www.marksandspencer.com).

After a change in leadership later in the year, he left to become an Engineering Manager at [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com). In 2017, Steve was promoted to VP Engineering for the Platform team. He is currently providing leadership and mentoring, leading over 90 engineers to build the new Alfresco platform.

Outside of work, Steve is an avid football fan and a season ticket holder at [Reading FC](http://www.readingfc.co.uk). He is also a runner, and has completed races at distances between 10km and half marathon.
