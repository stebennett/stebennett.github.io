<p>I&#8217;ve joined <a href="https://prostatecanceruk.org/get-involved/men-united">Men United</a> and I&#8217;ll be running the <a href="https://www.llhm.co.uk/">London Landmarks Half Marathon 2020</a> for <a href="https://prostatecanceruk.org/">Prostate Cancer UK</a>.</p>



<p><strong>You can support me by donating at my <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/steve2020">Just Giving Page</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men &#8211; in the UK, nearly 50,000 men are diagnosed with the condition each year and 11,000 dies from the disease. With 1 in 8 men getting prostate cancer in their lifetime, there&#8217;s a good chance that someone you will know someone who has been affected by prostate cancer.</p>



<p>Despite this, many men are still unaware of the disease, tests and unreliable and research is underfunded. By 2030, prostate cancer is set to become the most common cancer overall in the UK.</p>



<p>I took up running regularly last year to get a little bit fitter. I enjoyed it so much (ok &#8211; not every run) that I entered my first race &#8211; a local 10km race &#8211; in June 2019. Nine months later, I want to push myself to do something tougher.</p>



<p>The London Landmarks Half Marathon sees 14,000 runners taking to streets of London in a tour of the main landmarks across the capital. It will push me further than I&#8217;ve gone before, but I can&#8217;t think of a better way to raise some money for a charity that does so much good work for men across the UK. More details about the event can be found here: https://www.llhm.co.uk/</p>



<p>Knowing you&#8217;re supporting me will keep me going through the winter training months and on the day itself. What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;ll be helping to fund support and research for those diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p>



<p>Please dig deep and donate whatever you can. It will make a real difference.</p>
